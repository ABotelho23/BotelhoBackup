# s017Backup
This is an unofficial backup script designed from scratch for use in the Staples store #17.

I started this because of a lack of proper tools to perform this task. Copy and pasting via File Explorer was both slow, needed constant intervention, and usually doesn't succeed 100%.

I've made this script open source as it may be of good use to other techs, as well as to hopefully increase collaboration on best practices for a script like this.
